#Approach

I first read the documents related to voxels and its apcing and relation to 3-d world.
Then i moved onto popular and useful pydicom and nibabel commands to access and read DICOM and NIfTI files
After that, i tried to read the metadata and header files for both the files respectively and tried to get the relevant informations and their implications.

#Visualizations
Visuals are available in the ipynb file

#Observations and Challenges


The main observation i deduced is that it is simply not feasible to store brain MRI and other medical scans just as JPEGs as storing just as images will lead to loss of inforamtion which are important for research purposes.

Challenges:
I found it challenging to visualize voxel space and its relation to real world co-ordinates.
